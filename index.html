			<div class="info-col">				
				<dl>
				  <dt id="marriage">Marriage</dt>
				  <dd> <div id="hex"></div>Laws and state regulations that define marriage, civil unions, and domestic partnerships. The full range of these laws vary from constitutional bans or zero provisions for same sex relationships, all the way to full marriage equality.



</dd>
				  <dt id="adoption">Adoption</dt>
				  <dd> <div id="hex2"></div>
				  Adoption laws vary widely between states, from prohibiting adoption of a child to an LGBT parent to allowing both names of a same sex couple on the birth certificate of their child.  Laws regarding adoption also affect single parent adopters and unmarried opposite sex couples.




</dd>
				  <dt id="housing">Housing</dt>
				  <dd> <div id="hex3"> </div>Laws that address discrimination in the housing industry, both in renting and owning property, based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

</dd>
				  <dt id="hate_crimes">Hate Crimes</dt>
				  <dd>  <div id="hex5"></div> Laws that protect against crimes that are motivated by animosity against a protected class.   While some states have no hate crime laws, the majority of states do have at least some form of hate crime protection. LGBT-specific hate crime protection laws are a more recent development and include laws that provide protection for sexual orientation and gender identity. </dd>
				  <dt id="hospital">Hospital Visitation</dt>
				  <dd><div id="hex6"></div>Laws that restrict or permit same sex partners to visit one another in the hospital. New regulations were enacted under President Obama's administration in 2011 that required Medicare or Medicaid accepting-hospitals to allow patients to choose who may have visitation rights, as well as who can make medical decisions on their behalf. In these cases, patients cannot be discriminated against based on sexual orientation or gender identity.</dd>
				  <dt id="employment">Employment</dt>
				  <dd><div id="hex4"></div>Laws that address discriminatory practices in the work place. LGBT employment laws protect for sexual orientation and gender identity.

			<h1 class="intro">The Longevity of Laws</h1></div>
		<div id="footer" class="intro"><h1>About This Map</h1><p>"Fifty Years of Change" documents the laws the United States has passed in the last decade that both restrict and extend LGBT rights. Over the last fifty years, there has been a marked increase in the sheer quantity of legislation that deals with LGBT rights. The spikes in the number of LGBT-related laws are sometimes grouped in time by the fact that they restrict rights for LGBT individuals, while at other times the spikes consist mostly of laws that protect and extend LBGT rights. </p> 
<p>
By looking at LBGT rights through time one cannot deny that a fundamental conversation is currently underway in our country, and has been exponentially growing to this point. So why document the last fifty years now? The Supreme Court has recently heard two cases, Prop 8 and DOMA, and are expected to announce their decisions on these cases in early June of 2013.  These cases will have a significant impact on both state and federal laws, so we believe it is  important to review our nation's journey to this critical juncture for LGBT civil rights.</p>
